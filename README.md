# GifTastic

## Easy Giphy Viewing
Using GifTastic you are able to create topic buttons.  When clicking said buttons you are shown a list of 10 gifs taken from Giphy that correlate to the topic.  Each time you press the button, a new set of 10 gifs is generated until there are no more relating to that topic.
